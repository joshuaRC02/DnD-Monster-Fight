Current features:
-pick 2 monsters to fight
-13 monsters to choose from
-initial stats automaticaly grabbed
-initatives and unique attacks are initailized
-battle consists of
	-going back and forth
	-doing randomly decided attacks (only melee weapon attacks for now)
	-battle ends when one reaches 0 hit points

WIP/not yet started features (farther down the list the farther away it is and the harder it is to do):
-add more monsters
-ez monster input?
-flesh out the condition system to be actually functional
-functionality for more actions/spells
-passive abilties actually doing something
-being able to use skills like stealth
-movement system
-human control (not that hard just dont care to do yet)

I will try my best to log any info I deem important here. I will try to make a new version save every time I add a new functionality or fix an old broken one.
