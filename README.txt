Had the idea on: 06/19/2020
Started the coding on: 06/20/2020
Finished coding current version on: 06/22-23/2020

Current features: (everythings broken at the moment)
-pick 2 monsters to fight
-1 monsters to choose from
-initial stats automaticaly grabbed
-initatives and unique attacks are initailized
-battle consists of
	-going back and forth
	-doing randomly decided attacks (only melee weapon attacks for now)
	-battle ends when one reaches 0 hit points

I will try my best to log any info I deem important here. I will try to make a new version save every time I add a new functionality or fix an old broken one.
